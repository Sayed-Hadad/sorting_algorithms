## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand at least four different sorting algorithms.
- Comprehend the concept of Big O notation and evaluate algorithm time complexity.
- Choose the most suitable sorting algorithm for a given input.
- Understand the characteristics of stable sorting algorithms.

## Tasks

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **0. Bubble sort** |  Sort elements by repeatedly comparing and swapping adjacent elements. | ✅ |
| **1. Insertion sort** |  Build a sorted array by inserting each element into its correct position. (Stable Sorting) | ✅|
| **2. Selection sort** |  Divide the list, select the smallest/largest, and swap with the first unsorted element. (Unstable Sorting) | ✅ |
| **3. Quick sort** |  Recursively sort elements using a pivot, dividing and conquering. (Unstable Sorting) | In Progress |

## Compilation

Use the following compilation line:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 {entry_point_file} {function_file_name} {print_array_or_print_list_function} {output_file_name}
